    "name": "Pano House",
    "description": "The Pano House is a masterclass in conscious simplicity. This single-story home proves that the highest standards of bioconstruction and design can be achieved with local resources and a clear vision.\nBuilt using the CUT system with straw bales, the house combines two roofs: a green roof that insulates the main area and a sloped tile roof that crowns the loft, optimizing both thermal performance and aesthetics. Its terrace, covered by a pergola made of local round timber, extends outdoor living, seamlessly integrating the construction into the landscape.\nSelf-built with knowledge:\nThis project was raised by its promoters, turning every straw bale and every plaster coat into an act of conscious creation and self-sufficiency."
