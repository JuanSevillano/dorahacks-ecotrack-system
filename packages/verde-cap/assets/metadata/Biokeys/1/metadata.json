    "description": "La Nucia House redefines modern construction with the innovative Alfawall system. Its load-bearing walls are made of prefabricated straw modules, a structural and enclosure system that achieves the highest energy efficiency standards using local resources and low-logistical-footprint processes.\nThe design incorporates a smart natural vertical ventilation system that passively regulates temperature and renews air, expelling accumulated heat and ensuring a healthy environment across all floors. Interior clay and exterior lime plasters complement a building that breathes. \n Respectfully integrated into the terrain with retaining walls and a perimeter gravel drainage system, the house proves that advanced and sustainable construction is achievable.
