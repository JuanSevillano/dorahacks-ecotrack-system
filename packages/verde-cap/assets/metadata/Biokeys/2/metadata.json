    "name": "Álava House",
    "description": "The Álava house is a prototype of efficiency and conscious geometry. This single-family, one-story house with a loft merges two volumes: a rectangular prism and an octagon, each built with high-performance bioconstruction systems.\nThe rectangular volume integrates two structural systems: CUT and double stud frame, combined to create a continuous envelope insulated with 35 cm thick straw bales. Its ceramic tile roof is insulated with expanded black cork, maximizing thermal efficiency.\nThe octagon houses a workshop and is crowned by its most remarkable feature: a reciprocal timber roof structure. This system, where beams mutually support each other through precise geometry, is a feat of structural design and craftsmanship, supporting a green roof that blends the construction into the landscape.\nThe design is completed with a glass greenhouse that functions as a terrace and passive climate system. Interior clay and exterior lime plasters ensure a healthy and high hygrothermal quality environment."
