    "name": "Zuberoa House",
    "description": "The Zuberoa House redefines energy efficiency in bioconstruction through the innovative use of high-density 'jumbo' straw bales. This unconventional building system provides an exceptional thermal barrier, ensuring superior energy performance and unmatched indoor comfort throughout the seasons.\nIts elegantly simple design consists of a main rectangular volume with a second-floor overhang that adds dynamism to its façade. Each level—ground floor and first floor—is crowned by its own gable roof, creating a coherent and harmonious architectural profile.\nSophistication in simplicity:\n Every detail, from the choice of large-format straw to the clean geometry of its structure, reflects a commitment to healthy living and excellence in bioclimatic design."
