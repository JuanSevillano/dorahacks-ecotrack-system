    "name": "Katja House",
    "description": "The Katja House is a testament to what a united community can achieve. This two-story home, self-built by its promoter with the crucial help of volunteers and students from carpentry, plastering, and bioconstruction workshops, embodies the essence of the circular economy and collective learning.\nIts intelligent design combines a main volume with a gable roof and an intercepted tower with a green roof, creating a distinctive and bioclimatic profile. The strategically oriented terrace provides a protected space for enjoyment throughout all seasons.\nMore than a house, it is a legacy of shared knowledge.\nEvery clay plaster and every wooden beam tells the story of the hands that built it, transforming collaborative effort into a tangible and sustainable home."
